## Exploring the famous twin spirals problem (Lang and Witbrock 1988)

Early neural networks, with simple densely connected linear models, were unable to classify apart two interleaved spirals.

This program displays how easy the task becomes through domain transformation from rectangular to polar coordinates. It also shows that a more complex network can solve the problem to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, even if it may not be pleasing to the human eye. 

Various classified images of both polar and non-polar approaches are included in the repo.
